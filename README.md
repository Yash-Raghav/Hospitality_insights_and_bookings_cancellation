**Problem Statement**

A fictional hotel company is receiving customers from all over the world. For each guest it has various kinds of information regarding the demographic details of the customer, their needs, special requests, food preference and so on. Once it can predict whether the guest will get canceled, the management team can make better informed decisions regarding the forecasting and rooms status to increase the bookings and attract more customers. 

**Strategy**

The management team of the hotels has provided a dataset containing 119,390 distinct records and asked to do a brief analysis on what different factors affect the bookings and how to increase those bookings based on customer needs so they can be better prepared to provide with differt services.

Analysed completely in R language, a brief analysis was done on the major variables with different statistical techniques and visualisations for better clarity. After breaking down the data into meaningful insights, I created a predictive binary classification model to find whether a particular booking will get cancelled or will get materialised.

**Findings**

A brief analysis of certain variables which majorly affect the cancellation of the bookings is explained below. The exploratory data analysis showed that 63% of bookings got materialised while 37% of bookings(either pre-paid or not paid) were canceled. 

- The hotels are divided into city or resort hotels. Majority of bookings are received with the city hotel. The bookings cancellation is almost equally divided in the same ratio.
- On average guests staying in city hotel pay a higher ADR than resorts.
- Bookings usually jump to a high in the 3rd quarter, specially July and August every year.
- Bookings with a high lead time are more prone to cancellation given that with a longer duration, the plans get changed more frequently.
- Family bookings are less prone for cancellation.
- A major part of materialised bookings were not pre-paid. A high amount of cancellation was there in pre-paid non refundable bookings. This is important to note since a big part of bookings and revenue came from pre-paid cancelled bookings.
